        <p><strong>About OnTruck</strong></p>
<p>OnTruck is a new European start-up devoted to bringing the road transportation industry to the 21st century.</p>
<p>It is a B2B platform which connects and improves the relationship between companies and carriers in order to move pallets. We offer shippers a web platform to make the process of finding the right truck quick and simple with built-in track and trace. Carriers are able to accept shipments through a mobile app, letting them grow and manage their business with ease.</p>
<p>Regarding the team, everyone of us has had several start-up experiences and on average we have 10+ years of experience in somehow similar challenges. We know success, we know failure; we've built platforms from scratch, we've dealt with large legacy systems. We care about each other and about the product we're building.</p>
<p>We are backed by the top investors in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Your profile</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You're not afraid of tough challenges, both product-wise and technical, and like to contribute your views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You master the web platform, having built both server APIs as well as powerful frontend clients. You like both designing the architecture and coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are self-sufficient laying out a design in modern, responsive CSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have significant industry experience: your future peers have 10+ experience with this kind of platform and we're looking for somebody on the same level. Don't worry if you don't meet the full 10+ years requirement; just let us know how you managed to get to that level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You care about the product you're building and the problem you're solving, not just about the technology you're using. You take pride in choosing the best technical solution for a problem by taking all constraints into account, instead of chasing the latest shiny not-ready-for-production technology for the sake of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You master both JavaScript and at least one additional language, and have some knowledge of others. You must be comfortable working with both relational and nonrelational databases, both directly and using a ORM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have a degree (self-learned might work as well but elaborate on how you got your knowledge in computer science) in something like math, engineering or physics and you have significant knowledge in computer science, networks, algorithms, data structures and design patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You enjoy working in a team and appreciate modern development techniques such as code reviews, pair programming, high-coverage testing and automating things. You are polite when reviewing other people's work and take it well when you get feedback on yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You prefer working in a fast-paced start-up, with quick iterations, changes of direction, tight budgets, and chaos over a hierarchical, well-structured corporation with clear and well-defined assignments, and career paths.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The exciting part</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opportunities for personal growth and learning, every single day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A flat, laid-back culture. Everybody is encouraged to participate in discussions and contribute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-trust environment. We believe in giving autonomy to all our employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competitive salaries and stock options packages. We want everyone to have ownership and participate in company success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An awesome office in central Madrid (Sol). We are easily accessible by public transport, as well as close to public bike stations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible schedule. Though we strongly believe in face-to-face communication so we don’t allow regular remote working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
